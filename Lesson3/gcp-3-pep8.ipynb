[List comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) are a useful approach for creating lists in a consise way. We are not covering list comprehensions during the lessons, but here is a short example from the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html). In some cases, list comprehensions might make your code more readable and consise. In other cases, you might end up writing an excessively long statement which is difficult to read. Let's have a look at two options that produce the same output:\n\n**Option A**: This for loop iterates over a range, squares all values and appends them to a list\n\n    squares = []\n    for x in range(10):\n        squares.append(x**2)\n\n**Option B**: Square all values in the range using a list comprehension\n\n    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n\n\nBoth approaches are fine, and you are free to choose the option that you think makes the code more readable.\n```","metadata":{}}]}
