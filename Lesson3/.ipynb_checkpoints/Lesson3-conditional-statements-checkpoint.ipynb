The idea is simple: **IF** a condition is met, **THEN** a set of actions is performed. \n\n### A simple conditional statement\n\n**Let’s look at a simple example with temperatures**, and check if temperature 17 (celsius degrees) is hot or not: ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"temperature = 17\n\nif temperature > 25:\n    print('it is hot!')\nelse:\n    print('it is not hot!')","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What did we do here?\nFirst, we used the `if` and `else` statements to determine what parts of the code to execute.\n\nWhat do these tests do?\nThe `if` statement checks to see whether the variable value for `temperature` is greater than 25.\nIf this condition is met, `'it is hot'` would be written to the screen. \nSince 17 is smaller than 25, the code beneath `else` is executed.\nCode under the `else` statement will run whenever the `if` test is `False`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Check your understanding \n\nUpdate the value of `temperature` to a \"hot\" temperature in the cell below and run the same conditional statements as above again.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code indented under the if-statement is not executed if the condition is not True.
