We can easily create plots that are interactive, allowing us to view data values by mousing over them, or click to enable/disable plotting of some data. There are several ways we can do this, but we'll utilize the [Pandas-Bokeh plotting backend](https://github.com/PatrikHlobil/Pandas-Bokeh), which allows us to create interactive plots with little additional effort.\n",
